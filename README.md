# PyRC

PyRC is another app I've created in Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
It's an anonymous messaging, hosting, advertising, buying/selling, IRC-esk client.

# Files

You'll find the files on the other branches

# Installation

Just download a zip from one of the branches and extract it to it's own folder, and run the executable.

# Running a Server

Download a zip from one of the server branches.


# What It's About

With the exception of the so-called 'compilation server' which gathers and compiles all active servers
and displays them for all users authorized to access each of them, and perhaps some personal servers that
I may choose to run in the future, no servers that you encounter with this app are official, they are all
independently run.
