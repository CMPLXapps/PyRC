# PyRC

PyRC is another app I've created in Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
It's an anonymous messaging, hosting, advertising, buying/selling, IRC-esk client.

# Files

You'll find the files on the other branches.

# Installation

Just download a zip from one of the branches and extract it to it's own folder, and run the executable.

# Running a Server

However you run a server is up to you 

# What It's About

With the exception of perhaps some personal servers that I may choose to run in the future, no servers 
that you encounter with this app are official, they are all privately run.
